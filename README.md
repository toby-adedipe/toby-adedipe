At Gavel, I led the development of the messaging feature, new home screen, and video download feature using Typescript, React Native, Redis, Node.js, and socket.io. At Portee, I developed two MVPs for iOS and Android using React Native, Redux, GraphQL, and Firebase. I have a solid understanding of the latest mobile development trends and technologies and have a proven track record of optimizing app performance, reducing load time by 20%. As a skilled software developer, I am passionate about creating products that make a difference in people's lives. </h4>
